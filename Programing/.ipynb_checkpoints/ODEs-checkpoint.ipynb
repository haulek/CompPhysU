    "# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) arise in many fields of physics, but also in social and other natural sciences. \n",
    "Often, quantities are defined as the rate of change of other quantities (for example, derivatives of displacement with respect to time $\\dot{x}(t)$, $\\dot{y}(t)$ are related to $x(t)$, $y(t)$ and $t$). This results in ODE. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition \n",
    "\n",
    "If differential equation contains only one independent variable (such as time $t$) and hence only derivatives with respect to this single independent variable are present (like $\\dot{x}$, $\\ddot{x}$,...), we classify it as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). If derivatives with respect to more than one independent variables appear, we call it a `partial differential equation`. The latter is more challenging to solve (for example using `Finite element method`) and we will not discuss it here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ODE only total derivatives (and no partial derivatives) appear. In general, it might be written in a form\n",
    "$$F(t, y(t), \\frac{d y(t)}{dt}, \\frac{d^2 y(t)}{dt^2}, ... \\frac{d^n y(t)}{dt^n})=0$$\n",
    "where $F$ is an arbitrary function, and it could be non-linear in its arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest examples is the Newton's law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m \\frac{d^2 x_i(t)}{dt^2} = F_i(x_1,x_2,x_3,t)$$\n",

    "   $$ \\sum_{n=0}^N a_n \\frac{d^n y(t)}{dt^n} -r (t)= 0 $$\n",
    "   Here $r(t)$ is an arbitrary function, which we usually call source term.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Homogeneous ODE : In this case source term $r(t)=0$ and hence $y(t)=0$ is also a trivial solution. But note that homogeneous ODE can be non-linear.\n",

    "## Numerical solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Many general purpose numerical solvers have been developed, which are easy to use, and can solve an arbitrary ODE. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will discuss a few below: `Runge Kutta method`, `Numerov`, `Verlet`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "While very generic solvers exist in `scipy.integrate.ode`, the precision of the solution can be a problem. For example, it is hard to follow Newton's eq. of motion for a very long time as the precision might deteriorate (molecular dynamics is challenging). If ODE is non-linear, it tends to be even more challenging to solve numerically. For example, the numerical solution might exhibit instability in some regimes, which is called `stiffness`. This is often caused by the presence of different time scales in the underlying problem. For example, a non-elastic collision in a mechanical system typically occurs at much smaller time scale than the time for the motion of objects, and this discrepancy causes a very \"sharp turns\" in the curves of the state parameters. These are difficult to capture numerically.\n"
