# CompPhysU
Computational Physics for Undergraduates with Python.

The homepage for the class is at <a href="https://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~haule/488/">www.physics.rutgers.edu/~haule/488</a>.

Here we store codes and jupyter notebooks for the Computational Physics course for undergraduates at Rutgers.


You can download the entire git repository to your local harddrive by executing in the command line:

> git clone https://github.com/haulek/CompPhysU


To run jupyter notebook, navigate to the desired notebook (<name>.ipynb), and in the command line execute:

> jupyter notebook <name>.ipynb


Alternatively, one can use Anaconda-Navigator app, lunch "jupyter Notebook", and inside the web browser find the location of the notebook.
