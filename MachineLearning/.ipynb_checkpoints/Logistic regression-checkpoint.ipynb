    "Logistic regression can serve as a stepping stone towards neural network algorithms and supervised deep learning. For logistic regression, the minimization of the cost function leads to a non-linear equation in the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. The optimization of the problem calls therefore for minimization algorithms. This forms the bottleneck of all machine learning algorithms, namely how to find reliable minima of a multi-variable function. This leads us to the family of gradient descent methods. The latter are the workhorses of all modern machine learning algorithms.\n"
